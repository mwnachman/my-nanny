## Your Child's Interactive Companion and Household Organizer

### Summary

myNanny is an integrated Alexa/desktop service that provides a central place for parents to track their children's responsibilities and safety. Alexa gently prompts the child to provide information about his/her day, records required homework, reminds them about their chores, and suggests eating a healthy snack! Parents can check to see if their child made it home, assign chores, and send notes to their child through Alexa on their computers or mobile device.

### myNanny Keeps Kids Safe

myNanny welcomes kids home after school, and sends parents a text confirming their safe arrival. If they don’t check in by the time set in their schedule online, parents receive a text notification.  

### myNanny Makes Chores Fun

Let myNanny do the nagging for you! Alexa technology makes chore reminders easy. Kids receive a list of their responsibilities when they get home, and they confirm with Alexa when they have finished, updating the Dashboard so parents can review their progress.

### myNanny Helps Organize the Household

myNanny’s simple online interface gives parents a daily summary of their kids’ schedule and activities so that they can see their household at a glance. It’s a breeze to add chores and change schedules.
